# Weather-AV-Devs
Demo test for AV Devs

I have done in this demo as follow :

-Fetch current location detai.
-Use current city name from it and call weather API.
-Get whole weather detail, but display only temperature.
-On save event, I am saving the detail in local.
-Display detail on List and Bar Graph.
